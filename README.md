# Overview

For this project I decided to write a simple Java program to practice OOP concepts. My program will create three geometric objects and store the 
references to them in a single ArrayList. Circle, Square, and Triangle for example. Then, it 
will Iterate through the ArrayList and display the area of the three different shape objects.

The purpuse of this project is to practice object oriented programming concepts in Java. Such as: Using primitive data types and operators, Using Methods, Using abstract methods and abstract classes, Designing and creating your own classes that use inheritance and polymorphism, Using an ArrayList

# Development Environment

For this software I used IntelliJ IDEA as my development environment.
This program is written in Java. Libraries used: java.text.DecimalFormat, java.util.ArrayList.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I am planning to add more classes to my program. 
- Make the program more interactive, so it takes input from a user.
- Implement encapsulation and abstraction to hide complex code.
